## Key Changes

### 1. Microformats: Demoted to Phase 7 ⬇️
- **Reason**: Only 5-10% adoption
- **Status**: Still implemented, still supported
- **Change**: Just not top priority anymore

### 2. Standard Meta: Promoted to Phase 1 ⬆️
- **Reason**: 100% of websites have this
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - foundation for everything

### 3. JSON-LD: Emphasized as Highest Impact ⚡
- **Reason**: 41% and growing
- **Impact**: Google Rich Results, AI training, e-commerce
- **Trend**: Fastest-growing format

### 4. Social Media: Stays Phase 2 ✅
- **Reason**: 60%+45% = massive adoption
- **Impact**: VERY HIGH - social sharing critical

## Bottom Line

✅ **Mission Accomplished!**

Your feedback was correct - microformats have low adoption (5-10%).

All documentation now reflects **data-driven prioritization**:
1. Standard Meta (100%) - Phase 1
2. Social Media (60%+45%) - Phase 2
3. JSON-LD (41% ↗️) - Phase 3 - **HIGHEST IMPACT**
4. Everything else by adoption rate

**Microformats** are still in the project (already implemented!), just moved to Phase 7 where they belong based on adoption data.

---

**Result**: MetaOxide now has a clear, data-driven roadmap that prioritizes real-world usage! 🚀
